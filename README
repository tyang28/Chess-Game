DESIGN
The main starts then gives the user to load a file or start new.
If they load it runs a load file function that sets the board and turn.
if the start new this creates a starting chess board.
Then the program runs an infinte loop going from turn to turn until something happens
to break the loop like a quite checkmate etc. 
When a player inputs a move the function calls a make move fuction that then calls the 
valid move fuction for the peice it trying to move if that works it makes sure that the peice
isnt moving into check or other no peice specific reasons for that peice to be unablr to move
after the move the board to checks to make sure that there is no checkmate or stalemate.
This happens till run function kicks out and the program ends.

COMPLETENESS
We are unaware of any incomplete functionality other than the 
optional castling function. The code fails if a user inputs an invalid file 
name which we couldn't find in the instructions if we had to check that.
